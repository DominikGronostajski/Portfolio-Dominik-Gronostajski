# About me
I have worked in fitness industry for 7 years but I needed new challenges and decided to pursue my other passions. Previously, I was looking for irregularities in human body, now I am dedicated to do the same with software. I have already taken first steps in testing and I hope to move forward fast. I offer an open mind and eagerness to learn new things and grow. I am looking forward to working with you!
